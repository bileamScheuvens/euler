# Euler
### Solutions to project Euler problems in no particular order implemented in the julia language.
Usually barely enough for the solution, no focus on readability, elegance and documentation.
Optimized *just* enough for termination in a reasonable amount of time.

Obviously beware of spoilers if you were planning on solving them yourself first.
